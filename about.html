        <p>Our high school subjects mostly revolved around IT. We both went a vocational line which had both IT and media subjects 
            and you could choose one of the two fields in 2nd grade. 
            We also had the normal subjects like Math, English, Science and History, but most of our class time was working with our own self-defined IT projects. </p>       
        <p>In our last year we had more elective classes and both shared Physics and IT2. 
            Our IT subjects taught us about Python, JavaScript frameworks, databases, networking and whatever else we wanted to learn within IT. 
            For both of us that included game development and we've both learned Godot Engine and pygame. 
            We were also part of a project where we essentially made our own console program. 
            It had special built controllers and a game selector screen where you could pick between different games all made in pygame.         </p>

            <h2>Our Favourites</h2>
            <h3>Sportsperson: Antony ðŸ¤©ðŸ¤©</h3>
            <img src="images/antony1.jpg" alt="Antony Matheus dos Santos">
            <p>Antony is a footballer who plays for Manchester United and the Brazilian National Team. He transferred to Man U in 2022 from Ajax for a transfer fee of â‚¬95M. The gargantuan fee has placed him under a lot of scrutiny and (somewhat) unfair press.</p>
            <img src="images/antony2.jpg" alt="He scored!!">
            <p>He is known for his ball control and skills and plays on the wing, usually on the right side. Being a left-footed player, he benefits from cutting inside between defenders, and his signature shot is a curler into the far corner. He can be over-reliant on his left foot at times, and is known to be quite one-footed</p>
            <img src="images/antony_scary.gif" alt="Giving the opposition a scary look">
            <p>Although he may not bring the results and output wanted at times, I still massively respect him for his confidence and trust in himself. In moderation, self-confidence and belief in oneself is paramount to achieving what one wants.</p>
