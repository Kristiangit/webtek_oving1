        <p>Our high school subjects mostly revolved around IT. We both went a vocational line which had both IT and media subjects 
            and you could choose one of the two fields in 2nd grade. 
            We also had the normal subjects like Math, English, Science and History, but most of our class time was working with our own self-defined IT projects. </p>       
        <p>In our last year we had more elective classes and both shared Physics and IT2. 
            Our IT subjects taught us about Python, JavaScript frameworks, databases, networking and whatever else we wanted to learn within IT. 
            For both of us that included game development and we've both learned Godot Engine and pygame. 
            We were also part of a project where we essentially made our own console program. 
            It had special built controllers and a game selector screen where you could pick between different games all made in pygame.         </p>
